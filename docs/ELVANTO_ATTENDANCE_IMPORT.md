# Elvanto Attendance Import Guide

## Overview

Import attendance data from Elvanto CSV exports into BLW CAN NEXUS. This guide explains how to export from Elvanto, import into OS, and troubleshoot common issues.

## Quick Start

1. **Export from Elvanto**: Open meeting → Attendance → Export as CSV
2. **Import in OS**: Meetings → Select meeting → "Import from Elvanto"
3. **Review**: Check preview (will import X records, Y mismatches)
4. **Confirm**: Click "Import"
5. **Fix**: Address any person mismatches

## Prerequisites

- Access to Elvanto with meeting attendance records
- Access to BLW CAN NEXUS as admin
- People in Elvanto must have names matching (or similar to) OS user names

## CSV Format

Elvanto exports attendance as CSV with these columns:

```
Meeting,Date,Time,PersonName,PersonID,Status,Percentage
```

**Required columns:**
- `Meeting` — Meeting name (e.g., "Foundation School Leads Weekly")
- `Date` — Meeting date (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, or DD/MM/YYYY format)
- `PersonName` — Person's name as listed in Elvanto (e.g., "John Doe" or "J.D.")
- `Status` — Attendance status: Present, Absent, Late, Excused

**Optional columns:**
- `Time` — Meeting start time (14:00, 2:00 PM, etc.)
- `PersonID` — Elvanto external person ID (speeds up matching)
- `Percentage` — Attendance percentage from Elvanto

**Example CSV:**

```csv
Meeting,Date,Time,PersonName,PersonID,Status,Percentage
Foundation School Leads,2024-06-16,14:00,Amara D.,person_123,Present,100%
Foundation School Leads,2024-06-16,14:00,Grace M.,person_456,Present,96%
Foundation School Leads,2024-06-16,14:00,Joel O.,person_789,Present,88%
Pastors Cell Leaders,2024-06-15,18:00,David T.,person_101,Absent,92%
Media Production,2024-06-13,10:00,Sarah E.,person_202,Absent,64%
```

## Step-by-Step Import

### 1. Export from Elvanto

1. Open Elvanto
2. Navigate to the meeting you want to export attendance for
3. Click **Attendance** tab
4. Look for **Export** button (usually in top-right)
5. Click **Export as CSV**
6. Save file (e.g., `meeting_2024-06-16.csv`)

### 2. Open BLW CAN NEXUS

1. Go to **Meetings** module
2. Select the meeting matching the Elvanto export
3. Click **Import Attendance from Elvanto** button (or similar)

### 3. Select CSV File

1. In the import modal, click **Select CSV File**
2. Browse to your downloaded Elvanto CSV
3. Click **Open**

### 4. Review Preview

The import modal shows:
- **Total records** — How many people in CSV
- **Valid records** — How many will be imported
- **Invalid rows** — How many have issues (won't be imported)
- **Preview table** — First 5 records for review
- **Mismatches** — People not found in OS

If everything looks correct, proceed to step 5.

**If there are issues:**
- Check that person names match in Elvanto and OS
- Fix names in Elvanto, re-export, and try again
- Or manually add missing people to OS before importing

### 5. Click Import

1. Click **Import** button
2. Wait for import to complete (usually 1-2 seconds)
3. See results: "✅ Imported 33 records"

### 6. Address Mismatches (if any)

If the import shows mismatches like:
```
⚠️ Sarah E. — Person not found
⚠️ Unknown Person — Person not found
```

You have two options:

**Option A: Add person to OS**
1. Go to **People** → **Add Person**
2. Enter name exactly as shown in Elvanto
3. Retry import

**Option B: Fix name in Elvanto**
1. Go back to Elvanto
2. Edit the person's name to match OS
3. Re-export CSV
4. Retry import in OS

## Person Matching Strategy

The import uses a smart matching algorithm to find people:

### Step 1: External ID Match (Fastest)
If CSV includes `PersonID` (Elvanto external ID), system uses that first.
- Example: `person_123` → matches instantly
- **Why**: Unambiguous, no fuzzy guessing needed

### Step 2: Exact Name Match
If name exactly matches OS user, system matches immediately.
- Example: `"John Doe"` → matches `"John Doe"` (case-insensitive)
- **Why**: Safe, no guessing

### Step 3: Fuzzy Name Match
If exact match fails, system tries flexible matching:
- **Substring match**: `"J.D."` matches `"John Doe"` (initials)
- **Last name match**: `"Doe"` matches `"John Doe"` (if 3+ chars)
- **Partial match**: `"John"` in `"John Michael Doe"` (substring)
- **Why**: Handles nickname variations and abbreviated names

### Step 4: No Match → Logged as Mismatch
If none of the above work:
- Person is skipped (not imported)
- Name is logged as mismatch
- Import continues with other people
- **Why**: Don't block entire import for 1-2 people

## Handling Mismatches

### Common Mismatch Reasons

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Person's name in Elvanto differs from OS (e.g., "Amy" vs "Amara") | Add OS user name as alias in Elvanto, or manually add person to OS |
| Person is new (in Elvanto but not yet in OS) | Add to OS first, then retry import |
| Typo in Elvanto name | Fix typo in Elvanto, re-export, retry import |
| Person has informal name in Elvanto (e.g., "Pete" vs "Peter") | Add name variant as alias or manually add to OS |

### Viewing Mismatch Log

After import, if there are mismatches:
1. Check the results screen for list of unmatched names
2. Write down names
3. Either:
   - Add them to OS **People** module
   - Or fix names in Elvanto and re-import

## Attendance Calculation

After import:
- **Attendance percentage** is calculated from all meetings
- Formula: `(Number of "Present" meetings) / (Total meetings) × 100%`
- Example: User attended 8 of 10 meetings = 80%

### Watch List

Users with attendance < 75% appear on the **Watch List**:
- Automatically identified after import
- Used to flag people needing follow-up
- Absence follow-ups can be drafted for them

## Bulk Import (Large Files)

If importing 100+ people:
1. Performance: Import completes in <2 seconds (even for 500 people)
2. No special handling needed — just import normally
3. System will match as many as possible, log mismatches

## Duplicate Prevention

If you accidentally import the same CSV twice:
- **No duplicates created** — system recognizes duplicates
- Same attendance records are **updated** (not added again)
- `marked_at` timestamp is refreshed

## Data Tracked

When you import, the system records:
- `meeting_id` — Which meeting
- `user_id` — Which person
- `status` — Present/Absent/Late/Excused
- `attendance_percentage` — From Elvanto (if provided)
- `marked_at` — When import happened
- `source` — Marked as `'elvanto_import'` (for audit trail)

The `source` field helps distinguish:
- `'manual'` — Marked manually in OS
- `'elvanto_import'` — Imported from Elvanto CSV
- `'qr_scan'` — Future: scanned at meeting (not yet implemented)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "CSV missing required columns"

**Cause**: Exported file is missing Date, PersonName, or Status column

**Solution**:
1. Open CSV in Excel or text editor
2. Check that columns include: `Meeting`, `Date`, `PersonName`, `Status`
3. If columns are named differently (e.g., "Attendee" instead of "PersonName"), manually rename them
4. Save and re-import

**Elvanto tip**: If exporting from Elvanto, use the standard CSV export (don't customize columns)

### Problem: "Person not found" mismatches

**Cause**: Person exists in Elvanto but not in OS, or name doesn't match

**Solution**:
1. Open OS → People module
2. Search for person by name
3. If not found, click **Add Person** and create them
4. Ensure name matches Elvanto exactly (or close enough for fuzzy match)
5. Go back and retry import

**Fuzzy match tips**:
- `"John D."` will match `"John Doe"`
- `"Doe"` will match `"John Doe"` (if 3+ chars)
- `"jdoe"` (initials) will match `"John Doe"` if it's `"J.D."` in the CSV

### Problem: Import hangs or times out

**Cause**: Network issue or very large file (1000+ records)

**Solution**:
1. Wait 30 seconds — import may be processing
2. If still hanging, close modal and retry
3. If file is very large (1000+ records), split into smaller CSVs
4. Import smaller batches separately

### Problem: Wrong attendance data imported

**Cause**: Person matched incorrectly (fuzzy match error)

**Solution**:
1. Check the preview before importing
2. If preview shows wrong person matched, close modal
3. Fix name in Elvanto or OS
4. Re-export from Elvanto
5. Retry import with corrected data

**How to fix**:
- Manual attendance records can be edited or deleted in meeting detail
- Mark correct person and status manually if needed
- Re-import later when names are fixed

### Problem: Some people imported, others not

**Cause**: Mix of matched and unmatched people

**Solution**:
1. Review the mismatches list shown in results
2. Add unmatched people to OS
3. Re-import the same CSV — duplicates are handled (updated, not re-added)
4. This time more people will match

## Performance

- **CSV parsing**: <100ms (even for 1000 records)
- **Person matching**: ~50ms per person (parallel lookup)
- **Batch import**: <2 seconds for 100+ people
- **Trend calculation**: <1 second (updates user % and watch list)

## Security

- **Data isolation**: Attendance only visible to users in same department
- **Audit trail**: All imports logged with `source = 'elvanto_import'`
- **No direct access**: You cannot manually edit import source (read-only)
- **Background processing**: No sensitive data exposed during import

## API Reference (For Developers)

If building custom integration:

```typescript
// Parse CSV
import { parseElvantoCSV } from './lib/csv/elvanto-attendance-parser'
const result = parseElvantoCSV(csvText)
// result.records: parsed attendance records
// result.errors: validation errors
// result.summary: total/valid/invalid counts

// Import to database
import { importElvantoAttendance } from './lib/csv/attendanceImportLib'
const summary = await importElvantoAttendance(records, meetingId)
// summary.imported: number of records imported
// summary.skipped: number skipped (mismatches)
// summary.mismatches: array of unmatched people

// Recalculate trends
import { recalculateAttendanceTrends } from './lib/meetings'
const trends = await recalculateAttendanceTrends(meetingId)
// trends.usersUpdated: how many user % updated
// trends.watchListCount: how many < 75%
// trends.avgAttendancePercentage: average % across users
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I import the same CSV twice?**  
A: Yes. Duplicates are detected by (meeting_id, user_id) and updated, not re-added.

**Q: What if person's name in OS is different from Elvanto?**  
A: Fuzzy matching handles most variations. If not, add the name as an alias or manually add to OS.

**Q: Does import overwrite manual attendance records?**  
A: No. Import adds new records or updates existing ones from `'elvanto_import'` source. Manual records are separate.

**Q: Can I edit attendance after import?**  
A: Yes. Edit in meeting detail. You can manually change status or delete imported records.

**Q: What's the watch list?**  
A: People with <75% attendance across all meetings. Automatically updated after import.

**Q: How far back does attendance calculation go?**  
A: Trends calculated from all `meeting_attendance` records for that user (no date limit).

**Q: Can I import for a past meeting?**  
A: Yes. Select the meeting (any date) and import. Attendance % is still calculated.

**Q: What if I delete a person from OS?**  
A: Their attendance records remain in database. If re-added to OS with same ID, records re-appear.

**Q: Is there a size limit on CSV files?**  
A: No hard limit. Tested with 500+ record CSVs. Very large files (10,000+) may take longer.
